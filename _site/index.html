<p><strong>I work in the space where governments and the internet meet.</strong></p>
<p>My most recent project is <a href="https://democracyclub.org.uk/">Democracy Club</a>.
I set this up in 2014 in order to make local government better at delivering
information about elections.</p>
<p>It is now regarded as a leading organisation in the UK Democracy space. We are
trusted to deliver electoral information by GOV.UK, The Electoral Commission, Welsh Government
many media outlets including Facebook and <em>The Times</em>. Most importantly, we have a good working
relationship with the UK's electoral administration community.</p>
<p>Democracy Club was once described as &quot;an invaluable service for citizens&quot; by a government minister.</p>

<p>Previously I worked in central government at MoJ, DWP and GDS.</p>
<p>Before that I spent my time between NGOs, startups and charities, mostly working on
data, transparency and accessible websites.</p>
<p>One of the startups was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickCode">ScraperWiki</a> where I
worked on the design and implementation of the initially launched version.</p>
<p>Another notable project I worked on was FarmSubsidy.org, a project that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>played a key role in demonstrating the value of data-driven public finance journalism</p>
</blockquote>
