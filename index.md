**I work in the space where governments and the internet meet.**

My most recent project is [Democracy Club](https://democracyclub.org.uk/). 
I set this up in 2014 in order to make local government better at delivering 
information about elections. 

It is now regarded as a leading organisation in the UK Democracy space. We are 
trusted to deliver electoral information by GOV.UK, The Electoral Commission, Welsh Government
many media outlets including Facebook and *The Times*. Most importantly, we have a good working
relationship with the UK's electoral administration community.

Democracy Club was once described as "an invaluable service for citizens" by a government minister.
